# User Access Module

The User Access Module is considered a critical module, since it is responsible for generating user sessions and authenticating users(client or collaborators) for other modules.

## If error

If this module goes down, it can result on a catastrophic fail in the system since all authorization for users came from here, and most of other modules use cases relies on it.
